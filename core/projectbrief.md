# Project Brief

> *Foundation document that shapes all other files*

## Vision Statement

Create a robust AI Memory extension for Cursor/VS Code that enables persistent, intelligent memory management for AI assistants through MCP integration, with a beautiful webview interface and comprehensive file streaming performance optimizations.

## Core Requirements
<!-- Essential functional requirements that define success -->
- [x] âœ… MCP server implementation with stdio transport for Cursor compatibility
- [x] âœ… Memory bank file management with template-based initialization
- [x] âœ… Comprehensive async file operations with retry mechanisms and error boundaries
- [x] âœ… Performance-optimized streaming for large files (>1MB) with chunked reading
- [x] âœ… Input validation and security with Zod schemas and path sanitization
- [x] âœ… VS Code extension architecture with proper activation and command structure
- [x] âœ… React 19 webview with Tailwind 4 and modern build pipeline
- [ ] ðŸ”„ Metadata system with intelligent file categorization and search
- [ ] ðŸ“… Advanced AI integration features and context management

## Project Goals
<!-- Specific, measurable objectives -->
- **Primary Goal**: Deliver a production-ready AI Memory extension that enhances AI assistant capabilities in Cursor through persistent memory and intelligent context management
- **Secondary Goals**:
  - Achieve >90% test coverage with comprehensive unit and integration testing
  - Implement streaming performance optimizations reducing memory usage by 75% for large files
  - Create intuitive webview interface with modern UX patterns and VS Code design consistency
  - Establish robust MCP architecture supporting future extensibility and third-party integrations

## Project Scope
<!-- What's included and explicitly excluded -->
### In Scope

- Complete VS Code extension (VSIX) with webview interface
- MCP server with comprehensive tool and resource implementations
- Memory bank management with file templates and validation
- Performance optimization through StreamingManager and FileOperationManager
- Security hardening with input validation and CSP implementation
- Modern build system using Rollup + SWC, Vite, and Biome
- Comprehensive testing framework with Vitest and @vscode/test-cli

### Out of Scope

- Cloud-based memory synchronization (future consideration)
- Multi-workspace memory sharing (Phase 3)
- Real-time collaborative memory editing (future consideration)
- Integration with non-Cursor IDEs (initial scope limited to VS Code API)

## Success Criteria
<!-- How will you know when this is successful? -->
- [x] âœ… All 181 tests passing with >90% coverage
- [x] âœ… Complete Phase 1 architecture implementation
- [x] âœ… Streaming performance optimizations operational
- [x] âœ… Security validation and error handling comprehensive
- [ ] ðŸ”„ Successful VS Code Marketplace publication
- [ ] ðŸ“… User adoption and positive feedback from early adopters
- [ ] ðŸ“… Integration testing with real-world Cursor workflows

## Key Constraints
<!-- Technical, time, resource, or other limitations -->
- **Platform Compatibility**: Must work seamlessly with Cursor's MCP implementation using stdio transport only
- **Performance Requirements**: Large file operations must not block event loop; memory usage bounded and predictable
- **Security Requirements**: All inputs validated; path traversal prevention; CSP compliance for webview
- **Build Requirements**: Modern toolchain with fast compilation (SWC) and unified formatting (Biome)
- **Code Quality**: British English throughout; comprehensive error handling with Result<T,E> pattern

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete âœ…

**Phase 1 Core Architecture**: Successfully implemented async operations, performance optimization, security validation, and clean structure reorganization. All architectural foundations are now in place for advanced features.
