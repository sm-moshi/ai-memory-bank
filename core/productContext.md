# Product Context

## Why this project exists
- Cursor and similar tools lack a lightweight, persistent, modular memory system for project context.
- Developers need robust, rules-driven memory for agents, chat, and automation workflows.

## Problems it solves
- Eliminates the need for webview/GUI overhead for project memory.
- Provides a stable, extensible memory bank for CLI-first and agent workflows.
- Ensures project context is always available, auditable, and easy to repair.

## How it should work
- All memory is stored in modular Markdown files, managed by CLI and MCP tools.
- Self-healing logic ensures missing files/folders are auto-created from templates.
- Users interact via CLI, Cursor commands, or agent workflowsâ€”no direct file edits needed.

## User experience goals
- Fast, reliable onboarding and repair
- Clear feedback and error handling
- Seamless integration with Cursor and agent workflows
- Minimal setup, maximum stability
