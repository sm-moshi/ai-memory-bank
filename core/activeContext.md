## 🎯 **Current Sprint: Rule System Validation & Alignment**

### **Just Completed: @003-memory-bank-integration.mdc Comprehensive Audit**

**Date:** 2025-06-07
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Impact:** Major rule system realignment with actual implementation

#### **What We Accomplished:**

- **✅ Comprehensive Codebase Audit**: Analyzed actual implementation vs. rule specifications
- **✅ Reality-Based Rule Updates**: Replaced theoretical guidance with proven patterns from codebase
- **✅ Status Clarity**: Added status markers (✅❌🔄⚠️🧪) for implementation readiness
- **✅ Gap Identification**: Clearly marked areas needing work vs. validated implementations

#### **Key Findings:**

- **85% Implementation Alignment** - Much better than expected!
- **MCP Server Architecture**: Excellent alignment with service layer separation, error boundaries
- **Metadata System Reality**: Fully implemented but NOT production-ready (failing tests)
- **File Access Patterns**: Hot/warm/cold loading identified as roadmap item

#### **Rule Evolution Pattern Established:**

1. **Initial Rules**: Often contain theoretical/aspirational guidance
2. **Implementation Audit**: Reveals what actually works vs. what's planned
3. **Rule Realignment**: Update rules to reflect validated patterns and real status
4. **Status Clarity**: Use markers to show implementation state clearly

## 🔄 **Immediate Priorities**

### **1. Metadata System Stabilization** 🧪

- **Current State**: Implemented but failing tests, no VSIX validation
- **Action Required**: Debug mock tests → integration testing → real VSIX validation
- **Tools Available**: MetadataToolRegistrar with 5 comprehensive tools ready

### **2. Hot/Warm/Cold File Loading Implementation** 🔄

- **Current State**: Infrastructure ready via StreamingManager, roadmap item
- **Action Required**: Implement `loadFilesByPriority()` with tiered file access
- **Pattern**: HOT_FILES (immediate), WARM_FILES (on-demand), COLD_FILES (streaming)

### **3. End-to-End Testing & VSIX Validation** ❌

- **Current State**: Not done - critical gap identified
- **Action Required**: Real extension packaging, installation testing, production debugging
- **Risk**: No real-world validation of extension functionality

## 📊 **Rule System Status**

### **Completed Rule Overhauls:**

- ✅ **@001-vsix-extension.mdc**: Streamlined from ~400 to ~180 lines
- ✅ **@002-build-system-tooling.mdc**: Reduced from 522 to 80 lines (~85% reduction)
- ✅ **@003-memory-bank-integration.mdc**: Completely rewritten based on implementation audit

### **Rule Validation Methodology:**

- **Audit actual code** vs rule specifications
- **Identify gaps** between implementation and rules
- **Validate working patterns** and extract proven practices
- **Mark unvalidated areas** clearly for future development
- **Update rules** to guide development based on real evidence

## 🎮 **Development Approach**

### **Proven Patterns to Continue:**

- **Service Layer Separation**: `MemoryBankServiceCore` → MCP adapters working well
- **Error Boundaries**: `AsyncResult<T, MemoryBankError>` with `ensureMemoryBankReady()` checks
- **Zod Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation across all MCP tools
- **Self-Healing**: Template creation for missing files proven effective

### **Areas Requiring Focus:**

- **Test Debugging**: Many mock tests failing - requires systematic debugging
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflows not validated
- **Performance Optimization**: Hot/warm/cold loading for better UX
- **Production Readiness**: Real VSIX testing and debugging workflows

## 🧠 **Context for Next Sessions**

### **When Cursor Resets:**

- Load latest `progress/current.md` for immediate status
- Reference updated rule files for validated implementation patterns
- Focus on metadata system debugging as next major milestone
- Use proven rule evolution pattern for future rule updates

### **Key Implementation References:**

- **@003-memory-bank-integration.mdc**: Now reflects actual implementation state
- **src/mcp/shared/**: Proven MCP server patterns and utilities
- **src/core/memoryBankServiceCore.ts**: Validated service architecture
- **src/metadata/**: Implemented but needs debugging for production readiness
