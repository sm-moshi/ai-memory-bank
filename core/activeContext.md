# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
<!-- What's the primary objective right now? -->

**Phase 1 Complete, Transitioning to Phase 2**: We have successfully completed all Phase 1 core architecture objectives including async operations, performance optimization, security validation, and structure reorganization. The project now presents as a mature, production-ready extension with professional documentation. The immediate focus is on preparing for Phase 2 metadata system implementation and determining documentation publication strategy.

### Sprint/Phase Goal
<!-- What are you trying to accomplish in this iteration? -->

**Objective**: Consolidate Phase 1 achievements, establish professional project presentation, and prepare Phase 2 groundwork.
**Timeline**: Completed Phase 1 (4-5 weeks) ahead of schedule
**Next Phase**: Phase 2 Metadata System (targeting Q2 2025)

### Active Features
<!-- Features currently in development -->
- **Documentation Publication Strategy**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Determining which internal documentation should become public
- **README Professional Polish**: âœ… COMPLETE - User applied final formatting improvements with blockquotes and markdown syntax highlighting
- **Phase 2 Architecture Research**: ðŸ“… NEXT - Metadata system architecture and intelligent file categorisation design
- **Extension Marketplace Preparation**: ðŸ”„ PLANNING - Evaluating VS Code marketplace submission requirements

## Recent Changes
<!-- Last 2-3 significant changes made -->
- **2025-05-31**: User applied final README polish including blockquote formatting for better template compliance and markdown syntax highlighting for code blocks
- **2025-05-31**: Completed comprehensive README modernisation removing 150+ lines of redundant content and accurately reflecting Phase 1 complete status
- **2025-05-31**: Successfully resolved critical test failures across core modules and fixed FileStreamer performance bug
- **2025-05-31**: Added ai-memory-bank repository as development memory bank submodule for persistent project knowledge

## Next Steps
<!-- Prioritised list of immediate next actions -->
1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Evaluate documentation publication strategy - determine what should be public vs internal
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Complete Phase 2 metadata system requirements analysis and architecture design
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Prepare extension packaging pipeline for VS Code marketplace submission
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Conduct comprehensive integration testing with real Cursor workflows
5. **LOW PRIORITY**: Plan Phase 3 advanced features including multi-workspace support

## Active Decisions and Considerations
<!-- Current open questions or decisions being made -->

### Pending Decisions

- **Documentation Publication Strategy**: Which internal documentation (Phase 1 Architecture, Implementation Details, GitHub Best Practices) should become public
- **Metadata System Architecture**: Evaluate approaches for intelligent file categorisation, search indexing, and content analysis
- **Extension Distribution Timeline**: Determine optimal approach for VS Code Marketplace submission

### Technical Considerations
<!-- Current technical challenges or trade-offs -->
- **Documentation Boundaries**: Balancing comprehensive internal documentation with appropriate public documentation
- **Memory Bank Growth Management**: Strategy for handling large memory banks (>100MB) with continued performance
- **Search and Discovery**: Implementation of fast, intelligent search across memory bank content
- **Content Intelligence**: Balancing automated content organisation with user control and privacy

### Blockers and Dependencies
<!-- What's preventing progress? -->
- **No Active Blockers**: Phase 1 completion removes all architectural blockers for Phase 2
- **Documentation Review Needed**: Internal documentation readiness for public consumption needs assessment
- **External Dependencies**: Phase 2 success depends on Cursor MCP API stability and continued stdio transport support
