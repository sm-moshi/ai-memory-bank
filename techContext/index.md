# Tech Context Index

> *Summary of technology stack, environment setup, and technical constraints*

## Architecture Overview

The AI Memory Extension is built with **Node.js 20 LTS** and **TypeScript**, leveraging **VS Code Extension API** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for core functionality.

The webview interface is implemented with **React 19** and **Tailwind CSS 4** for a modern, responsive UI that integrates seamlessly with VS Code's design system.

## Modern Build System

Build and tooling systems use **Rollup** with **SWC** for 20x faster TypeScript compilation, **Biome** for unified linting and formatting, and **Vitest** for comprehensive testing with >90% coverage.

The build pipeline supports multiple targets: VS Code extension (CommonJS), MCP server (CommonJS), and webview (ES modules) with optimised bundles for each environment.

For complete build system specifications, see [stack.md](techContext/stack.md).
For detailed dependency list and versions, see [dependencies.md](techContext/dependencies.md).

## Quality Foundation

The project maintains strict TypeScript configuration with comprehensive error handling using the Result<T,E> pattern throughout. All inputs are validated with Zod schemas, and security is hardened with path sanitization and CSP implementation.

Performance is optimised through intelligent streaming for large files (>1MB) and bounded cache management with LRU eviction.

For current quality achievements and metrics, see [progress/current.md](progress/current.md).

## Technical Constraints & Design Principles

Key constraints include **Cursor MCP stdio transport compatibility**, **VS Code API limitations**, **performance requirements for large files**, and **comprehensive security validation**.

All dependencies and configurations are chosen for **rapid development velocity**, **long-term maintainability**, and **production reliability**.
