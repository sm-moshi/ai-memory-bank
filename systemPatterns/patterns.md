# Patterns

- Modular file structure for memory, context, and progress
- Self-healing: auto-create missing files/folders from templates
- Rules-driven: all operations checked for safety and consent
- Async/await for robust, concurrency-aware file IO
- Extensible: easy to add new tools, resources, or modules
