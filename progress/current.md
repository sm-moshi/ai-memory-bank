# Current Progress

## Current Sprint/Phase
- **Name**: Phase 1 Complete → Phase 2 Preparation
- **Duration**: 2025-05-15 - 2025-06-30
- **Goal**: Consolidate Phase 1 achievements, documentation, and prepare Phase 2 metadata system architecture

## Active Work Items

### Recently Completed ✅
- **README.md Modernisation & Polish**: COMPLETE - Applied user refinements including blockquote formatting, markdown syntax highlighting, and documentation visibility notes
- **Template Formatting Standards**: COMPLETE - Fixed MD036 linting violations across all template files, established comprehensive formatting rules
- **Critical Test Failures Resolution**: COMPLETE - Fixed FileStreamer performance bug, corrected test mocks, achieved 181/181 tests passing
- **Memory Bank Submodule Integration**: COMPLETE - Successfully added ai-memory-bank repository as development memory bank

### In Progress 🔄
- **Documentation Consolidation**: 95% - Memory bank populated with comprehensive project knowledge, README reflects mature state
- **Phase 2 Planning**: 25% - Initial research into metadata system architecture and intelligent file categorisation
- **Documentation Publication Strategy**: 15% - Evaluating what documentation should be public vs internal

### Ready for Review
- **Phase 1 Architecture Documentation**: Ready for technical review - Comprehensive documentation of completed core architecture
- **Project Structure Reorganisation**: Ready for validation - Clean separation of concerns achieved across src/ directory

## Completed This Sprint
- ✅ **README.md Final Polish**: 2025-05-31 - User applied formatting improvements with blockquotes, corrected markdown syntax highlighting, noted internal documentation status
- ✅ **README.md Major Overhaul**: 2025-05-31 - Removed 150+ lines of redundant content, fixed outdated commands, modernised to reflect Phase 1 complete status
- ✅ **Template Formatting Crisis Resolution**: 2025-05-31 - Fixed MD036 violations across all template files following established formatting rules
- ✅ **Critical FileStreamer Bug**: 2025-05-31 - Fixed bytesRead/chunksProcessed primitive number bug that caused performance metrics to always return 0
- ✅ **Test Suite Stabilisation**: 2025-05-31 - All 181 tests passing, comprehensive mock corrections applied

## Blockers and Issues

### Resolved Blockers ✅
- ✅ **Template Linting Violations**: Resolved by converting emphasis to blockquotes in template files
- ✅ **Test Failures**: Resolved critical FileStreamer bug and mock mismatches
- ✅ **Documentation Gaps**: Resolved by comprehensive memory bank population
- ✅ **README Accuracy**: Resolved with modernisation reflecting current mature state

### No Current Blockers 🎉
- **Phase 1 Completion**: All major architectural blockers removed
- **Technical Foundation**: Stable, well-tested, and production-ready
- **Documentation Quality**: Professional, accurate, and properly formatted

### Planning Considerations
- **Documentation Publication Strategy**: Need to determine which internal docs should become public
- **MCP API Stability**: Continued monitoring of Cursor MCP protocol changes
- **Performance at Scale**: Preparing for larger memory bank scenarios in Phase 2

## Metrics and Health

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ maintained across all modules
- **Build Status**: ✅ All builds passing (extension, webview, MCP server)
- **Known Issues**: 0 critical, 0 major bugs
- **Performance**: Streaming optimisations operational for files >1MB
- **Code Quality**: Biome compliance 100%, TypeScript strict mode enforced
- **Documentation Quality**: Professional formatting, accurate content, proper template compliance

### Architecture Achievements
- **Clean Architecture**: ✅ Services properly separated (utils → services → core)
- **Performance Optimisation**: ✅ StreamingManager integration complete
- **Security Hardening**: ✅ Comprehensive Zod validation and path sanitisation
- **Modern Toolchain**: ✅ Rollup+SWC, Biome, Vitest fully integrated
- **Documentation Standards**: ✅ Template formatting rules established and applied

### Project Maturity Indicators
- **README Quality**: ✅ Professional, concise, accurately reflects current state
- **Template Consistency**: ✅ All templates follow established formatting standards
- **Code Organisation**: ✅ Clean separation of concerns achieved
- **Testing Foundation**: ✅ Comprehensive test suite with stable mocks

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1-2 days)
1. Complete documentation publication strategy evaluation
2. Review and validate Phase 1 architectural decisions documentation
3. Begin Phase 2 metadata system research and design

### This Week
1. Finalise Phase 1 completion documentation and lessons learned
2. Design metadata system architecture patterns and APIs
3. Evaluate intelligent categorisation algorithms and approaches
4. Determine public vs internal documentation boundaries

### Next Sprint Planning
- **Focus Areas**: Phase 2 metadata system design, search architecture, content analysis patterns
- **Capacity**: Full development capacity available with stable foundation
- **Dependencies**: Continued Cursor MCP protocol stability, community feedback integration

## Notes and Decisions
- **2025-05-31**: User applied final README polish with blockquote formatting, corrected markdown syntax highlighting, noted documentation visibility
- **2025-05-31**: README modernisation successfully removes 150+ lines of outdated content, reflects mature Phase 1 status
- **2025-05-31**: Template formatting standards fully established and applied across all template files
- **2025-05-31**: All critical test failures resolved, foundation extremely stable for Phase 2

## Phase 1 Achievement Summary
**100% Complete** - Core Architecture Objectives Achieved:
- ✅ Async file operations with retry logic and error boundaries
- ✅ Performance optimisation via StreamingManager for large files
- ✅ Security hardening with comprehensive validation and sanitisation
- ✅ Clean code architecture with proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Modern toolchain integration (Rollup+SWC, Biome, Vitest)
- ✅ Comprehensive testing with >90% coverage maintenance
- ✅ British English standard enforcement throughout codebase
- ✅ Professional documentation with established formatting standards

**Project Maturity**: Extension ready for production use with comprehensive documentation, stable architecture, and professional presentation.

**Ready for Phase 2**: Metadata System development can begin immediately with stable foundation and clear documentation standards.
