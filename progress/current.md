# Current Progress

- Documentation and repository setup completed
- Memory-bank submodule re-initialised from scratch after .git loss
- Submodule README created and best practices documented
- WIP and root docs cross-referenced and clarified
- 2025-05-16: Audited docs/dev/memory-bank-core.md and docs/dev/mcp-server.md. No implementation code found in src/core or src/cli; documentation is forward-looking and aligns with project rules. Next step: begin implementation of memory bank core and MCP server as described in docs. üêπ

## Next steps
- Begin implementation of core features as outlined in IMPLEMENTATION.md and TODO.md
- Keep documentation and memory bank in sync as code is written
- Regularly update progress and planning docs
